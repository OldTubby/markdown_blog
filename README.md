# markdown_blog

This project was significantly inspired by Kyle with Web Dev Simplified.

You'll find a basic blog built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.  Blog entries can be created, viewed as a list, edited, and deleted.

I enjoyed this project and chose to build it in order to brush up on Express.
